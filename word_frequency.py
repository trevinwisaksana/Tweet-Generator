A histogram() function which takes a source_text argument
(can be either a filename or the contents of the file as a string, your choice)
and return a histogram data structure that stores each unique word along with
the number of times the word appears in the source text.

A unique_words() function that takes a histogram argument and returns the total
count of unique words in the histogram. For example, when given the histogram
for The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, it returns the integer 8475.

A frequency() function that takes a word and histogram argument and returns the
number of times that word appears in a text. For example, when given the word
"mystery" and the Holmes histogram, it will return the integer 20.
